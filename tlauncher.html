    <h1>Downloading the modpack</h1>
    <p>You need <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-edition">Minecraft: Java Edition</a> and a compatible launcher (see section below) in order to use this modpack.</p>
    <p style="font-size:150%;">You can download the modpack by clicking <a href="https://github.com/jbmagination/debsmikle/releases/latest/download/debsmikle.zip">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>"Installing" the modpack for TLauncher users</h2>
    <p>First, press the <i>TLMods</i> button. Choose the <i>Create</i> button at the top, and write "debsmikle" as the name. Set the game version to 1.19.1 if it's not set to that already - everything else can be as-is. Choose <i>Create</i>.
    <p>"debsmikle" should now be a selected modpack. Open the dropdown, and select the management icon next to "debsmikle". Then, choose <i>Open mod-pack folder.</i></p>
    <p>Extract the .zip and open the contents of the <i>.minecraft</i> folder. Copy or move the contents of that folder into the folder that was just opened in TLauncher.</p>
    <p>Under which version you want to select for launching Minecraft, choose <i>Release debsmikle</i>. You can now launch the game as normal.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> TLauncher skins and capes are not supported, as they (usually) pulled off with a mod for the Forge mod loader. This modpack uses the Fabric mod loader.</p>
